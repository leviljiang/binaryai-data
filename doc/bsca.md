# Binary SCA

> We compare BinaryAI with the existing binary-to-source SCA tools including two academic tools: OSSPolice and B2SFinder, and two well-established commercial products: Scantist and Synopsys Black Duck. Their details are described as follows.



## OSSPolice

- OSSPolice is proposed to identify TPLs within binary files based on a hierarchical indexing scheme

## B2SFinder

- B2SFinder is the start-of-the-art academic binary-to-source SCA tool, which employs a weighted matching algorithm to facilitate the binary source code matching
